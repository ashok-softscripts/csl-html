						<h3>Why are you passionate about sustainability? What was the moment or event that made you decide to become a 'change maker' in your field?</h3>
						<p>I am passionate advocate of resource efficiency and waste minimization. I truly believe that businesses can solve social problems while making a profit and that realising a more sustainable world requires new attitudes, approaches, skills and new ways of going about our business.</p>
						<h3>How did CSL play a role in directing your current path or project?</h3>
						<p>Through CSL, I became aware of the ability to use procurement practices to change the world for the better. By integrating sustainability considerations into the procurement process, big business can create opportunities to improve efficiency in energy usage, reduce waste generation and water consumption, optimise logistics and increase recycled material content - all initiatives which offer an environmental improvement while reducing costs and improving the business bottom line. CSL taught me leadership skills that I intend to impart to the younger cohort at my work - I can't wait to develop the next generation of change makers!</p>
						<h3>In 25 words or less, tell us why leadership for sustainability is important.</h3>
						<p>No matter whether the change you are trying to effect is on large or small scale, radical or incremental, global, domestic or local social change requires committed leadership to make it happen.</p>
						<h3>What do you plan to do next on your sustainability journey?</h3>
						<p>I want to continue demonstrating that the commercial and sustainability imperative can exist hand in hand and that sustainable procurement can be as a vehicle to simultaneously improve the bottom line and improve environmental and social outcomes.</p>
						<h3>What are three words you would use to describe the Fellowship Program?</h3>
						<p>Empowering, Engaging and Insightful.</p>
